## NFL Linear Regression Project

This repository contains a simple linear regression analysis of the relationship between NFL teams' points-per-drive and average starting field position. The [data used](../master/nfl_drives.csv) was obtained from [pro-football-reference.com](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2015/index.htm).

For an in-depth discussion of the approach and results, see the included [report](../master/report.pdf).

This project was an assingment in an Applied Statistical Methods course (MATH 4753) at the University of Oklahoma during the Spring 2016 semester.
